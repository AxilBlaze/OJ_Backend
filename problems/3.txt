# Problem 3: Two Sum
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

Input:
The first line contains an integer n (number of elements in the array).
The second line contains n space-separated integers (the array).
The third line contains the integer target.

Output:
Output two integers, the indices (0-based) of the two numbers that add up to target. If there are multiple answers, output any one.

Sample Input:
4
2 7 11 15
9

Sample Output:
0 1
